# Natas Websec CTF Fieldnotes

* http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master
* https://github.com/rctay/sublime-text-2-buildview
* for splitting sublime window into text + console
* install build view plugin
* type: build view in sublime console to enable 

## Natas6

* https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter-html-tidy
* decode html install plugin: stringencode
* execute from console: html denetize
* 

The page checks if post requests matches to string specified in /includes/secret.inc, which is a php file that is accidentily accessible via the browser because of the wrong file name extension. After deobfuscating the sourcecode was readable.

'
<?
$secret = "FOEIUWGHFEEUHOFUOIU";
?>
'

## Natas7 local file inclusion

*<!-- hint: password for webuser natas8 is in /etc/natas_webpass/natas8 -->
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38476648/python-requests-call-with-url-using-parameters
* define params for php requests for python module requests

The page is vulnerable for local file inclusion: accessing files outside of the web root. The PHP script is able to read files from the filesystem which are not in webroot and should not be publicly accessible

* https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Local_File_Inclusion

## Natas8

* php file which compares entered password to encoded hardcoded password
* take source code and run it to decode the pw-string

<?php
echo base64_decode(strrev(hex2bin("3d3d516343746d4d6d6c315669563362")));
?>

output: oubWYf2kBq

## Natas9 command injection

* https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Command_Injection
* needle php: https://teamtreehouse.com/community/what-is-needle-and-haystack-in-php
* ; is a bash feature which executes multiple in a single line

The page is vulnerable to command injection. The search field input does not escape some characters correct.

http://natas9.natas.labs.overthewire.org/?needle=%3Bls&submit=Search

output: dictionary.txt

## Natas10 command injection

* similar to natas9 but with escaped char: if(preg_match('/[;|&]/',$key))
* an attacker can circumvent this escape by passing two arguments to the grep command

## Natas11 XOR "encryption" of cookies (not solved)

* https://docs.python.org/2/library/urllib.html
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_gate
* https://medium.com/@m.f.m.barber/natas-11-and-reverse-engineering-xor-encryption-6133bca7cf64

got stuck on modifying php script to xor cookie data and key to new cookie data
